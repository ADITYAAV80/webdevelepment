<h4><span>CAP'N AMERICA</span></h4>
<p id="p2">
Steve Rogers was born during the Depression and grew up a frail youth in a poor family.
His father died when he was a child, his mother when he was in his late teens.
Horrified by newsreel footage of the Nazis in Europe, Rogers was inspired to try to enlist in the Army.
However, because of his frailty and sickness, he was rejected.
Overhearing the boy's earnest plea to be accepted, General Chester Phillips of the U.S. Army offered
Rogers the opportunity to take part in a special experiment called Operation: Rebirth.
Rogers agreed and was taken to a secret laboratory in Washington,
 D.C. where he was introduced to Dr. Abrahan Erskine (code named: Prof. Reinstein), the creator to the Super-Soldier formula.
